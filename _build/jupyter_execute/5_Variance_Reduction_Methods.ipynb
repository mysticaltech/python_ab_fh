    "Using a frequestist framework can come with some frustrating pitfalls. Namely, detecting statistical significance can be difficult when a large degree of variance exists within a metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aforementioned challenge of detecting small differences to statistical significance relates to correspondingly low statistical power. When an experiment is underpowered, statistical analysis will likely return non-significant findings between your experimental conditions, regardless of whether a true and meaningful effect actually exists. In addition, low statistical power is exhibited when the treatment effect is too small in relation to the variance of the metric that is being assessed. Given that within-group variance is often high in web-data; where both super-users and \"one-hit wonders\" exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the positive relationship that exists between sample size and experiment sensitivity, the large within-metric variance that is exhibited within our data is a constant, and thus often inhibits the detection of a statistically significant result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily methods currently exist that look to use pre-experiment information to control for within metric variance, which subsequently increases the statistical power of experiments. One such method is [CUPED](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237838291_Improving_the_Sensitivity_of_Online_Controlled_Experiments_by_Utilizing_Pre-Experiment_Data) (controlled using pre-experiment data) which relies on the removal of variance within a metric that is attributed to pre-experiment information. CUPED is implemented on the notion that variance that pre-experiment data can explain in a metric is not correlated to any effects elicited by the change in a given experiment and can therefore be omitted from analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " It is recommended that the pre-experiment covariate (continuous metric) we are looking to integrate is the same as our primary experiment metric. This is because the increase in experiment sensitivity — achieved through a reduction in within-metric variance — is predicated on a strong correlation between the covariate and primary experiment metric, and so using the same metric is preferable. The correlation between the covariate and primary metric is then used to compute a constant (theta) that is applied to each unit (cookie_id), which is our CUPED-adjusted metric which we can then run a statistical test on:\n",

    "In this Notebook we will use Pvs_per_session data collected prior to our Keanu experiment and use it to control for variance that is unrelated to the experiment itself, in order to increase the sensitivity of our statistical analysis.\n",
